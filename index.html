    <h1>Welcome to Christian's Programming Portfolio!</h1>
    <p>Thank you for coming to my website. I created this site for the CSC 106 class at the University of Rhode Island.<br>
The site is mostly empty at the moment, but will later contain some of my javascripts and apps.<br> You can click
around at the top to access the different parts of the website such as the "about me" page.<br> This website was created using HTML.</p>
